<h1>this is the repo for the "riverless walk" interactive installation</h1>

<h3>Artist statement</h3>
<p>
This installation will build off a recent piece, <a href='http://hcwiley.com/installation/building-bridges-out-of-buildings' target='_blank'>"building bridges out of buildings"</a>, which sought to bridge the gap of presenting a three dimensional object on a two dimensional surface; I want to extend this idea to an entire environment instead of just one object. By expanding the interaction to encompass an entire room rather than just the area in front a screen, I will be able to develop a more complex relationship with the viewer and the space he is occupying. For the viewer to understand the virtual environment he must spend time moving around the physical space. By simply walking around the room once the viewer will see the virtual environment Iâ€™ve created, but the longer the viewers spends exploring the space the more he will understand what the virtual environment is and how it relates to itself and to physical spaces. I am interested in using the body as an interface but abstracting that fact from the viewer.
